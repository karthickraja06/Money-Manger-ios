🚀 Project: Axio-Style Personal Money Manager (Frontend Only)

You are building a frontend-only web application for a personal money manager, inspired by Axio Money Manager, but custom-built.

⚠️ Important constraints

DO NOT implement backend logic

DO NOT implement real API calls

USE mocked data / placeholder API services

Frontend must be fully functional using mock data

Backend integration will be added later manually

Tech Stack:

Mandatory:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

Preferred (flexible if needed):
- Zustand or React Context for state
- Recharts for charts
- date-fns for dates
- Lucide Icons

Use equivalent lightweight alternatives only if required.

🎯 Core Goal

Modal opens with list of recent credit transactions

Allow multi-select

🏷 AUTO-CATEGORIZATION UX

User can override anytime

All charts must react to filters.

🔍 FILTER SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)

Global filters (applies everywhere):

🧪 DATA & API HANDLING (IMPORTANT)
Data Models (use TypeScript interfaces)

Account

Transaction

RefundLink

Budget

Due

MerchantMapping

API Layer

Create a services/api.ts

Functions like:

getAccounts()

getTransactions()

getBudgets()

⚠️ These must return mock data only

🎨 UX EXPECTATIONS

Mobile-first

Clean financial UI

Clear positive/negative indicators

Smooth transitions

Empty states handled

Loading skeletons

🚫 DO NOT

Do not build backend

Do not connect real APIs

Do not store data permanently

Do not simplify flows

✅ FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTED

Fully working frontend

All screens wired

Mock data flows

Clean component structure

Ready to plug backend later without redesign

Build this as a production-quality frontend, not a demo.
✅ EXTRA (Optional but Encouraged)

Keyboard shortcuts

Search everywhere

Monthly comparison view

Account health indicators

Anomaly detection UI (placeholder)

Start with this assumption:

“Backend exists, frontend just consumes clean APIs.”
